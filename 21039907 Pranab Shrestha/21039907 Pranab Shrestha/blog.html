			<h2>Effects of Technology</h2>	
			<p>My smartphone, out of all of my gadgets, definitely provides me with the greatest benefits. I'm grateful that its map applications can direct me and my car to my location and propose alternate routes if traffic is heavy. It plays any music I choose and pulls up my e-mails so I can work even while I'm stopped at a red light. I can tour cities all around the world in seconds thanks to the applications, websites, and programs. It sends me amusing internet gifs and memes, and I've even made real professional connections through its social media channels. I admire and genuinely admire you at times.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Technology has affected my life in every possible way such as studies, entertainment, communications, etc. Due to covid, we as students could not attend physical classes so through meeting applications we could attend the classes online which prevented our period be lost. I even learned many things online which helped me in the assignments and learned new hobbies. During the lockdown, I had many courses of entertainment which was based on technology such as games which I played a lot and made new friends through in-game voice chats which were not available before which was later upgraded in the game.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Technology has its upsides and downsides as everything does everyone does spend more time on their phones and laptops scrolling through social media, playing games, watching movies, and all. I can't help myself either I often spend my time playing games and scrolling through the internet and social media for a long period and I don't even realize the time passing by. which eventually declines my health and harms my education cause I find myself spending more time on my gadgets rather than doing my assignments and working myself to be better.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Now a days technology has a main role on education since covid every collages and school are running online classes s</p>
			<br>
			<p>So, technology has its advantages and disadvantages but it positively helps everyone if it is used properly. The innovation of the new gadgets will eventually benefit everyone which will make everything easier and more efficient for everyone. Technology is an important part of everyone day to day which makes things easier and more efficient and innovation makes technology better, faster, and more convenient. </p>
